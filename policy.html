    <h1>Privacy Policy for Volunteer Tracker App</h1>
    <p><i>Last updated: 6/20/2023</i></p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how the ChronoKeepr App manages personal
      information and respects your privacy. This policy applies to all users of
      our mobile application ChronoKeepr.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <p>
      The App does not collect any personal data of its own. However, it allows
      users (organizers) to manually enter and store information including
      names, email addresses, zip codes, and organizations on their own device.
      This data is entered at the discretion of the user and used solely for the
      purpose of tracking volunteers. We do not access, use, or share this data
      in any way.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <p>
      All data is stored locally on the user's device. We do not store, back up,
      or have any access to this data. While we aim to provide a secure
      environment for data storage on the device, we do not have control over
      the security measures on individual devices and cannot guarantee absolute
      security.
    </p>

    <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      Our App is suitable for users under the age of 13. However, we do not
      collect or maintain data from anyone, including children under the age of
      13. We advise adults to monitor the use of our App by minors.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Rights</h2>

    <p>
      Users have the right to manage their own data entered into the App. As we
      do not collect or store personal data, we are unable to assist in data
      deletion or modification requests. Users should delete or modify data
      directly within the App on their device.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We advise you to
      review this page periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy
      Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
    </p>
